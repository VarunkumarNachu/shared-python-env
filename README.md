# Shared Python Environment Setup

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the setup script:

- On Windows:
```bash
setup_env.bat
```

- On macOS/Linux:
```bash
bash setup_env.sh
```

This will create a virtual environment and install all required packages from `requirements.txt`.
